# A deterministic Turing Machine simulation
A simulation of a deterministic Turing Machine that decides if the input string is a palindrome. The input string must be of the alphabet {a,b}\*. The TM returns _a_ if true, _b_ otherwise.

### Run instructions
Assuming Haskell is installed along with ghc or Stack.
First, load the GHCI environment in terminal: 
```
> stack ghci turingMachine.hs
```
(Remove 'stack' if you don't use Stack)

To run the script, simply type the following prompt in the GHCI environment:
```
> main
```

Follow the instructions printed in the terminal.
